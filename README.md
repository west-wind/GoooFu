A simple script to automate Google Hacking & save the results to an HTML file during an authorized penetration test.
WARNING: Executing this script multiple times may cause Google to block your IP address. Prerequisite python modules needed: google, random, & time. To install prerequisite modules, run 'pip install module_name'. 

Working on chaning the bot behaviour which results in Google blocking the IP.

P.S: I'm fairly new to Python & penetration testing.
